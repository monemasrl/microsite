# Product Landing - Images

This folder contains theme-specific images.

You can add:
- Logo files
- Icons
- Placeholder images
- Background patterns
- Any other static images needed for the theme

Images referenced in the `content.json` file should be hosted externally (e.g., on a CDN, Unsplash, or your own server) or placed in the root `/static/images` folder of your Hugo site.
